description: '"Her mother died when she was born, but Rilla''s grandfather, an old
  lighthouse keeper, never told her father about the child. When her grandfather dies,
  Dr. Lem, his boyhood friend, sends Rilla to school. Gene, a boy she has known in
  her island home, goes to England and becomes the friend of a great nobleman. When
  an Irish shipmate of the grandfather writes to an address found in the old man''s
  iron box, the lord is disclosed as Rilla''s father"--Jacket.'
